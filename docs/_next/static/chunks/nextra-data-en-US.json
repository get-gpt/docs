This allows you to easily use our service in various mainstream ChatGPT clients. We cover platforms such as iOS, iPad, macOS, Linux, Windows, and Chrome, while supporting multiple programming language SDKs, enabling you to conveniently, quickly, and securely use our product.In the following link, you can find usage methods for some common products:How to UseIf you encounter any issues during use, feel free to contact us. Our support team will be dedicated to answering your questions and helping you fully utilize the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT.\n\n\nWhat is API Key?\nSimilar to the OpenAI API's API-Key, we will generate a unique personal API-Key for you after registration. If it is accidentally leaked, you can generate a new API-Key to ensure safety.\n\n\nWhat is Proxy-Domain?\nSimilar to the official OpenAI API domain (https://api.openai.com/), we offer multiple proxy domains for you to choose from, in order to provide better network lines and extremely fast response speeds. Please note that to use these proxy domains, you need to use them in conjunction with our provided API-Key.\n\n\nCan API Key be shared?\nAn API-Key is an important tool for authentication and access protection. In some scenarios, you can share your API-Key within a certain scope with trusted partners. However, it is not recommended to share your API-Key too frequently, as it may lead to the following issues:\nSecurity risks: Abuse and improper use of the API-Key can result in data leaks and security threats.\nService abuse: If shared with untrusted individuals, they may abuse your API-Key.\nPrivacy concerns: Sharing your API-Key with others may expose your personal data and information to theft and misuse.\nService limitation: Excessive sharing could lead to the service provider banning or restricting your API-Key, affecting normal usage.\n\nIn conclusion, although sharing the API-Key can be considered in specific scenarios, it is best to treat this issue cautiously to ensure the safety of your data and services.\n\n\nThe distinction between us and OpenAI\nAll our Chat services are built on top of OpenAI's services, and are perfectly compatible with OpenAI's formats and features. On this basis, we have established our own billing standards and related configurations, allowing users to use OpenAI's Chat services more conveniently. This way, our users can enjoy a high-quality AI conversation experience while benefiting from the customized solutions we provide for them.\n\n\nThe difference between us and an intermediary agent opening an account\nOur service aims to provide you with a safer and more convenient experience. Compared to opening an OpenAI account through intermediary agents, using our service allows you to directly access and experience Chat functions without bearing the management costs and security risks associated with intermediaries.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between us and a VPN proxy?\nOur core advantage lies in providing you with OpenAI functions in a simple and easy-to-use form, rather than traditional VPN services. With our service, you can seamlessly use advanced NLP technology without worrying about the complexity of VPN setups or potential account risks.Our service can help you achieve the following goals:\nProvide a simple and easy-to-use interface, eliminating the need for complex VPN settings and the risk of potentially getting your account banned.\nAccess powerful OpenAI features without regional restrictions.\nReceive high-quality user support and services, fully enjoying the value brought by OpenAI technology.\n\nBy choosing our service, you will be able to fully utilize the potential of OpenAI technology while remaining convenient, efficient, and secure.\n\n\nIs the data safe?\nWe attach great importance to the privacy and security of user data. Besides conducting token cost statistics and collecting email addresses for ease of communication with users, we do not store any user data. This means that you can use our services with confidence, ensuring your privacy is protected. We will continue to focus on data security and privacy policies to provide the best user experience.\n\n\nIs the service free?\nOur services operate on a paid model. However, to allow new users to understand and experience our product, we offer a certain number of free trial credits. This allows new users to fully understand and evaluate whether our product meets their needs before deciding to purchase the official service, ensuring the best user experience.\n\n\nBilling criteria\nBased on OpenAI's Token/Model billing standards, we have added corresponding service fees on top of that, with no additional costs. To understand the specific fees and billing methods, please refer to our billing page.\n\n\nHow to recharge?\nTo recharge, you can visit the \"Get Start\" entrance on our website, and then choose the amount and recharge method you need. We offer multiple payment options to meet the needs of different users.
